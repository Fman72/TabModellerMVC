# TabModellerMVC
Users can edit, filter, create, delete, save and load guitar tab so that can always convert tab to the format they like!

The app has 3 views one which can filter guitar tab, one which detects the chords in guitar tab and one which shows a textual representation of guitar tab.


Try it out:

https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/t/the_who/baba_oriley_ver5_tab.htm
https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/t/the_beatles/here_comes_the_sun_ver2_tab.htm
https://tabs.ultimate-guitar.com/d/deep_purple/black_night_ver4_tab.htm

NOTE: The app cannot handle all tabs. There are so many quirks to different authors tabs that it would take a much larger and more complex application to handle all the different styles.
Regex can only do so much.
